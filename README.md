# Formula-AI
AI model and evolutionary algorithm built from scratch in python for self-driving F1 cars. Running the program will create a pygame window in which the cars can be seen driving on the track and a visual of the currently best performing network. 

## Functionalities
* Variable number of layers and nodes
* Zoom, pan, and simulation speed control
* Saves generation data to JSON on exiting program
* Loading JSON capability to continue training
* Reorders nodes in layers based on node bias for clarity
* Can run on any track image that follows strict color coding

## Example

## Requirements
* Numpy
* Pygame
* Pillow
